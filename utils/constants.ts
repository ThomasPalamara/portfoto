    description: `Scotland is my favourite holiday destination. 
    Among its many wonders, the Cairngorms stand out, boasting ancient Caledonian forests andmysterious lochs.
    Watching red squirrels playfully leap through the trees and observing the unique crested tits is an absolute joy in this peaceful place.
